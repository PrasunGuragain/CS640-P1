Topology:
    # Sender (port 5000) ---- Emulator1 (port 3000) ---- Requester (port 4000)
    # Sender (port 5001) -----|

Run t5c and t5d separately, and collect the runtime of the requester.
t5c: On the emulator, no delay or packet lost; queue size is large enough to avoid queue full error.
t5d: On the emulator, 10ms delay for the link betweeon emulator to the requester.
