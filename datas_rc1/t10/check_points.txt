1. Generated output file is correct.
2. The latency is in a reasonable range (around 5 seconds). 
   Sender side:     In this case, the rate on the sender side is 100 packet/second. delay=1/100=10ms.
                    The total data packet number is 517.'
                    Three senders send packets simutaneously.
   Emulator side:   No delay/lost for emulator. The queue size is long enough to avoid queue full error.
   => The latency should be around 10ms*517~=5s.
3. The requester prints the summary information correctly.
4. The sender prints the lost rate as 0.
5. The emulator log can be empty.
